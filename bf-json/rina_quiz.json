Smoke? You do. Drink? uh huhhhh. Exist solely on a diet of homemade rice krispie treats eaten off a plate like hungry a baby bird? Duh! You're known for always finding a way (THE way) of doing the situationally most outlandish (yet completely) endearing thing. You're also very sexually alluring. One would think your seductive forces would be hindered given your proclivity for goofy hats and candy jewelry, but they'd be wrong. While that which puts the *Dirt* in Dirty Rina is easily recognizable, at your core, you are magnetic, spirited and FUN. Hilarity is a serious endeavor for you and you fuel those around you with your sense of it.",

Sure, but only if they don't stain the 15 manuscripts you're currently reading. But it's not all work and no play for you sweet angel, Carina Kate. You always make time for your friends because you're loyal AF, funny as shit, and most importantly, very, VERY hot.",
